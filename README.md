## Recommendations
### If you were to adivse the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
* One service I beleive Roofstock should offer are internal finance options. They currently partner with other Fintech companies to offer finance options to investors. However, if they offered that service themself they could create more revenue.
### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* I beleive that if Roofstock were to offer in house financing it would not only help their customers purchase the home a little quicker it would also open up access to additional cash-flow from the interest that is earned from the mortgages. It would also allow them to sell the mortgages to a secondary market that would create fast liqudity options. 
### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
*	+ API  
	+ Deep Learning
	+ Smart Contracts
### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* API would be one of the technologies that would be needed to communicate with secondary market prograns such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Deep Learning to go through the requirements the third party has and make sure they coincide with the mortgage that is getting ready to be sold. Lastly, Smart Contracts so that once Roofstock is ready to sell the mortgages they can be tracked and ensure payments have been transferred.
